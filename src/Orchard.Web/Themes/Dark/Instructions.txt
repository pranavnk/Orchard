/* Bind Custom Theme: Dark */


*** SEARCH NOTICE ***

The Dark theme uses a custom Search Form,
so the Search Feature should be enabled or there will be a error:

The Search feature should be installed:
Orchard > Gallery > Modules

and then enabled:
Orchard > Settings > Features

If you wish to decline the usage of search, please replace
Document.cshtml with DocumentNoSearch.cshtml in Themes\Dark\Views folder of Orchard installation


*** ZONES **

The Dark theme uses the same 19 Zones as "TheThemeMachine" Theme.

Some zones have demo content that can be edited in Themes\Dark\Views or removed in Layout.cshtml
Entries can be found below "Inserting some ad hoc shapes"

Bind Team
